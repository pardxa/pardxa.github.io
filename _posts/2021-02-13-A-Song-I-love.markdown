My mother told me\
Someday I would buy\
Galleys with good oars\
Sails to distant shores

My mother told me\
Someday I would buy (buy)\
Galleys with good oars\
Sails to distant shores


Stand up high in the prow\
Noble barque I steer\
(Steady) steady course for the haven\
Hew many foe-men\
Hew many foe-men
